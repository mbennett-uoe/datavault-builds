    If you are happy for all the data to be deleted on the review date ${vault-review-date}, please
    email the Research Data Support team to let us know that, at ${help-mail} .
    If on the other hand you believe some or all of the deposits should be kept beyond the review date, please email the
    Research Data Support team with the following details:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Which deposits you want to keep and which you want to delete;</li>
    <li>The length of time of the extension / the new review date;</li>
    <li>How you intend to pay the cost of the extension (from a budget code or from an active grant).</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If we do not hear from you, we will seek confirmation from your Head of School as to whether the data may be deleted
    or should be kept.
</p>
<p>
    Please donâ€™t hesitate to ask if you are unsure, and would like to discuss the risks and benefits / pros and cons of
    keeping or deleting the data.
